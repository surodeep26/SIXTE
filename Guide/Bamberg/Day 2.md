- [ ] finished creating the proper SIMPUT files and model generation 
- [ ] accounts generated in uni-erlangen 

## todo
- [ ] fix the distribution of the sources in the sky so that it is uniform. currently randomly drawing out of ra and dec results in higher concentration of sources near the poles (dec=90,-90)
- [ ] solution: create the sources in spherical coordinates with uniformly distributed $\theta$ and $\phi$ and then convert them into RA and Dec for the source catalog.
- [ ] Write to axel about that kind of sources do we need in the foreground/background. basically what xspec models.
	- [ ] should we include a 3d nh map? or should the background just be a constant?

## new
- information about how to run the simulation on computers here.
